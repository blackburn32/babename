bio:
  headline: What are we [about?]{.text-primary}
  content: |
    At the intersection of indie rock, dreamy pop, and jangly folk one finds the fearlessly vulnerable
    world of babename. Jamie Averley writes from the heart -- specifically the heart of a pandemic-
    times-baby-queer stumbling their way into a life worth living. Mildly awkward and painfully
    sincere, babename looks at the world through reborn eyes. With gentle wit and melody, their
    journal-esque overshares bring us into journey through fantasies of new beginnings, sapphic
    yearning, and musings on identity, power, and possibility.

    For as long as they can remember, music has been the way Jamie Averley makes sense of the
    world. Songwriting offers both a window into someone’s thoughts and an emotional outlet in a
    way no other form of writing can. During a period of solitude and self-reckoning, music became
    even more intertwined with identity. Coming into their trans identity offered inspiration and
    liberation.

    Highlights is a time capsule of transformation. A collection of songs about queerness, self-
    discovery, loss, and the courage to return to oneself. Still early in their career, Averley
    approaches their art with gratitude and curiosity. Each deeper step - writing, recording,
    performing - has returned meaning tenfold. “My voice, even as it wavers, has something to say”
    says Averley. “These songs have given me clarity and self-knowledge. I only hope they can do
    the same for someone else.”
